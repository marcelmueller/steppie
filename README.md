# Steppie

## What

Steppie is a simple pedometer that imports step count data from HealthKit. 

## Why

While there are dozens of apps out there that do the same (and much more), I like the idea of focusing on a single feature and experimenting with different ways to display it. 

I have three main goals for this project:
- Continue my learning and practice of Swift;
- Work with HealthKit. Apple has been doing an outstanding work with its Health features and I would love to make use of that;
- Skip using any design tool and design the app straight inside the development workspace;

## Feedback
